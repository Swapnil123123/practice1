s industrialized, agriculture continues to be important elsewhere in the district. Since most arable land is still rain-fed,
the southwest monsoon season (between June and September) is crucial to the district's food sufficiency and quality of life. 
Fluctuations in time, distribution or quantity of monsoon rains may lead to floods or droughts. The eastern part of the district has been historically drought-prone,
but irrigation provided by dams, canals and wells have made agriculture less dependent on rainfall.[117]
The overtapping of aquifers has led to increased water salinity in the talukas of
Purandhar, Baramati, Daund, Indapur and Shirur (in the eastern part of the district), threatening agriculture and the drinking-water supply
.[118]
